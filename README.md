# Have It Better (HIB) - A Software Home Page 
This project was build in my first days of learning the web development. It is a free template for personal and commercial use, but make sure **not** to:
- Take it as it is and sell it, or
- Use the logos as yours

## Installation
This project used CSS and Javascript, so just clone the project to your hard disk, and that is it.

## Contributions
Contributions by all means are appreciated, but I don't want to reject any pull request after someone (or you) has worked many hours on this project. So, please email me at dev.mkebsi@gmail.com with your idea before taking actions.
